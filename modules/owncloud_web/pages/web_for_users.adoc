This sections describes the web UI from a regular user's perspective without administrator privileges.

== Introduction

{description}

If you have been using ownCloud before but with the classic user interface on an ownCloud 10 server, you may want to check out section xref:web_with_oC10.adoc[ownCloud Web with ownCloud Server 10.x] to get an overview of the main differences.

The following description assumes you're new to ownCloud.

== Top Navigation

=== Application Switcher

The square in the upper left corner with the nine tiles is your application switcher. There you can switch between `Files` and `User management` and installed apps.

=== Global Search

The new search not only scans the content in your ownCloud spaces, but also in applications like chat tools or on the web.

// work in progress, uses Bleve.

=== Mode Switcher

Depending on your preferences or light conditions you can switch between `dark mode` and `light mode`.

=== Account Menu

image:account-menu.png[]

All the way to the right, the little round icon with your initials opens a menu that takes you to your account information or the settings section, shows your quota as well as usage of storage space and allows you to log out.

== Left Sidebar

=== Personal

Under `Personal` in the left sidebar you have your private space where you can upload files and folders or create them directly on Infinite Scale.

You can also share files either via public link or internally with others users on the same Infinite Scale instance by invitation. Either way, you can grant permission to access files as Viewer or Editor.

=== Shares

Under `Shares` you can see all files or folders that have been shared with you. You can accept the share or decline. You can see who the owner of the share is and who else it has been shared with. Then there's the time or date when the content has been shared.

A click on the three vertical dots opens an actions menu. Actions can be performed on a file or folder depending on the file type (video, text, etc.) and on the permissions granted by the sharer.

=== Spaces

Spaces are organizational units to sort content and make it available to certain members.

Under `Personal`, every user has a private space, while the `Spaces` area is intended for collaboration, i.e., sharing on a larger scale.



In spaces, editors can do a little more and there's the additional role of manager.

A user with editor privileges for a space can also edit the space name and description, change the cover image for a space and empty the trash bin.

Every space must have at least one manager. Managers of a space have all the rights of viewers and editors. In addition, they can:
* invite additional members,
* edit the quota of a space,
* change the roles of members, including those of other managers. Downgrading a manager to viewer or editor is possible.

=== Deleted Files

Under `Deleted Files` you find content that you have deleted from your `Personal Space`. Here you can either really delete the file for good or restore it if deletion was a mistake.

image:file-restore.png[Delete or Restore]

TIP: If files in one of the spaces are deleted, they are placed in the trashbin of the respective space so they can be restored from there. Go to the `Spaces` overview, click on the vertical three dots in the space representation and select `Deleted Files`. You'll be directed to the space's trashbin where you can delete for real or restore.

// fixme: If with beta 1 users still end up in the `Deleted Files` section afterwards, add a note here.

== Right Sidebar

The right sidebar can be opened via the square icon with the dark or gray sidebar under your avatar symbol in the upper right corner. image:sidebar.png[]

Here you find details about selected files: name, size, last modification time and with whom they have been shared. From here you can also use the `Actions` menu and reach the `Share` section.

=== Sharing

If you have been using the standard web interface on ownCloud server previously, the new way of sharing may require some getting used to, but it's even simpler now.

Sharing is either done via the icons to the right of a file or folder or via the `Actions` menu or by opening the right sidebar and clicking `Shares`. In any case, the right sidebar provides you a dialog where you can choose between inviting people registered on the Infinite Scale instance by entering their names or email addresses in the `Invite` field and click btn:[Share] or by sharing via link.

A quick-action link also works for external people not registered on the Infinite Scale server. Below the `Share with people` section, provide a name for the link and set an `Expiration date` and a password before hitting btn:[Share].
For security reasons, the only possible role for unregistered users is `viewer`.

=== Versions

If you modified a document stored in Infinite Scale, you can always restore older versions. When collaborating with other people on the same documents, versioning is very important. If you share a document with an editor, you want to be able to check what happened with the document.

// FIXME: Elaborate more when it's working. Is there a diff to come? I hope so.
